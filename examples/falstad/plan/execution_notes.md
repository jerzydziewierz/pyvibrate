notes on execution:

## bandpass.txt

with haiku: $0.1566
with sonnet:  $0.61 with added request for extra documentation. result in examples/falstad/filters/bandpass_rlc/sonnet/*
with haiku again, but with extra documentation: $0.1788 ; note - did not make any plots, otherwise, successful.
with opus: OMFG! it noticed that the other guys have already created an implementation. It also noticed that haiku got it wrong (wrong formula for Q); 
it noticed that "i am probably being tested" and it says, "OK, let me do it better..." hahahaha!
 -> cost: $1.42 -- but what a result! beautiful.
